# Medical-Imaging-Practical

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for Medical Imaging. It demonstrates basic image processing techniques for medical images using Python and key libraries such as `pydicom`, `skimage`, and `matplotlib`. It includes functions to:

- Load and inspect DICOM metadata
- Map pixel values to meaningful units
- Apply windowing for tissue visualisation
- Enhance contrast and adjust intensity
- Identify and measure regions of interest
- Convert DICOM images for analysis
- Visualise and export processed images

## Requirements
Before running the notebook, ensure the following packages are installed:
- numpy==1.26.3
- pandas==2.2.0
- matplotlib==3.8.2
- pydicom==3.0.1
- scikit-image==0.22.0

You can install missing dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -q numpy==1.26.3 pandas==2.2.0 matplotlib==3.8.2 pydicom==3.0.1 scikit-image==0.22.0
